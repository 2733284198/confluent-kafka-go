Testing
=======


Some of the tests included in this directory, the benchmark tests in particular,
require an existing Kafka cluster and a testconf.json configuration file to
provide tests with bootstrap brokers, topic name, etc.

The format of testconf.json is a JSON object:
```
    {
       "Brokers": "<bootstrap-brokers>",
       "Topic": "<test-topic-name>"
    }
```

See testconf-example.json for an example.


To run unit-tests:

    $ go test


To run benchmark tests:

    $ go test -bench .
