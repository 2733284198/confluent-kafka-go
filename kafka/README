Information for confluent-kafka-go developers
=============================================


Whenever librdkafka error codes are updated make sure to run generate before building:

    $ (cd go_rdkafka_generr && go install) && go generate
    $ go build





Testing
=======

Some of the tests included in this directory requires an existing Kafka cluster
and a testconf.json configuration file to provide tests with bootstrap brokers, topic name, etc.

The format of testconf.json is a JSON object:
    {
       "Brokers": "<bootstrap-brokers>",
       "Topic": "<test-topic-name>"
    }

See testconf-example.json for an example.


To run tests:

  $ go test
